  \section{Problem Identification}
    \subsection{Key issues}
      There are many behavioural disorders that affect human comfort and living
      standards. One of the most common behavioural disorders is 
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD is characterised by 
      the decline in focus over periods of time due to low  brain activity
      prompting the brain to become hyperactive to reach healty activity 
      levels (Zentall, 2006, p.50). Sufferers require external stimulation 
      supplementary to the low stimulus activity to maintain focus
      (Ayres, 2005). Performing motor activity has been shown as a reliable way
      to reduce hyperactivity and distractibility in ADHD patients 
      (Azrin, et. al 2007).\\ \\
      Current testemony indicate that the primary issue is that ADHD sufferers
      tend to loose attention when presented with information which can have
      negative affects on school performance as well as work-place relations
      as distractible workers are regarded as poor performers.

    \subsection{Affected population}
      ADHD has not shown any bearing on geographical location or ethnicity.
      ADHD is correlated with age showing that simptoms tend to decease with
      increasing age of patients (Josephine, et. al 2018). The simptoms are 
      primarily present in groups that are required stay stationary and give
      attention to one activity for an extended period of time. \\ \\
      By this it is concluded that the affected population is children in 
      school and young adults working white collar jobs.

    \subsection{Short commings of existing solutions}
      Existing solutions include fidget toys which altough effectivity is
      somewhat proven (Amanda .R 2011). These toys require the use of 1 or 2 hands, which can be
      a hinderince when concidering the use of a sufferer's hands in a class
      room or work setting, In the class room an fidget toy taking up a hand can
      make it difficult for the student to take notes, or a worker to use tools
      or type on a keyboard. \\ \\
      Another concern is that of noise, many existing fidget toys can produce
      noise especially when used veroucisously as is common with children.
      these toys also have a tendency to degrade over time causing the device to
      produce even more noise. The presence if noise makes these devices
      impractical for use in a classroom aswell as meetings or any other noise
      sensitive environments where sufferers will be required to focus.


    \subsection{Evidence to support the investment decision}
      According to a 2016 study on factors that promote resilience in youth with
      ADHD simptoms (Melissa R. Dvorsky). The single bigest factor is social
      acceptance. Thus the prority sould be to symptomatically treat ADHD
      symptoms with as little effect on the surrounding social environment.
